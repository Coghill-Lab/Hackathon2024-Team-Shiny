I had a biopsy a couple days later, and I want to brag on the gentleman who called to set that appointment as the schedulers can often be overlooked, but are a very important part of the process also!! He was very professional over the phone, very understanding, and took my name down to be able to get me in sooner than the original available appointment. A time opened up and he called me back so I was able to be scheduled before I left town which helped tremendously; because, I live seven hours away. I was thrilled; he actually took my information and followed up when an appt opened up the day after. Most schedulers don't care, and you never hear back. He was very professional over the phone! I was very impressed with the process of checking in for the biopsy. The Cuban Lab Technician was very professional, and pleasant. She took four or five viles of blood, and I never felt a thing!  The nursing staff at radiology was Also welcoming and pleasant. The resident doctor and surgeon were both excellent in speaking with me about the biopsy and making sure I was pain free during the process! Such a wonderful experience all the way around!
